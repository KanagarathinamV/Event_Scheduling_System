This Java-based Event Scheduling System allows users to register events, view existing events, and register for events as attendees through a graphical user interface (GUI). The system utilizes `JFrame` and `CardLayout` to manage different panels: one for event registration, one for viewing events, and another for event registration as an attendee. It features input validation for event creation and attendee registration, event display with attendee counts, and a basic event management system that stores and retrieves events in memory. The ultimate goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for scheduling and managing events.
